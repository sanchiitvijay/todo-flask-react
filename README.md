# Todo App

This project is a simple Todo application with a backend API using Flask and PostgreSQL, and a frontend built with React.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- PostgreSQL
- Python 3
- Node.js and npm

### Backend Setup

1. **Create the PostgreSQL Database and User**

   Open the PostgreSQL CLI with `psql` and run the following commands to create a database and set up a user with a password:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE todo_app;
   CREATE USER postgres WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'shoo';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "todo-app" TO postgres;
   ```

   Replace `'shoo'` with a secure password of your choice
   
2. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

3. **Activate Virtual Environment**

   If you haven't set up a virtual environment yet, you can create one using:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

   Then activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install Requirements**

   Install the required Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the Flask Server**

   Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the necessary Node modules:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
